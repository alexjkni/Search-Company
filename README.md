\f0\fs24 \cf0 Test: WinningMoves-Test - Search Companies\
API Used: Company House API\
\
Time Taken: 5 hours\
\
Problem: Lack of experience working with the Laravel API\
\
Solution: Looked up official Laravel documentation and created a basic \'93Test\'94 Application where I created several different \'93basic\'94 testing applications to help figure out the ins and outs of larval.\
\
Problem: Connecting to Search Companies API\
\
Solution: Looked up making a http request using authentication header to include the API Key provided by Search Companies house\
\
Problem: Wanted CSS & JS Files to be included as default in the view\
\
Solution: Researched the \'93blade\'94 templating engine. Allowed for a master template to be produced that includes the standard CSS & JS files on all views.\
\
Problem: Getting HTTP requests to \'93connect\'94 to the appropriate controller\
\
Solution: Read deep into standard \'93route\'94 procedures in Laravel, Set the pathnames to \'93route\'94 to the appropriate Controller AKA:\
\
/ => searchCompanitesController@index\
api/searchCompany => searchCompanyController}
