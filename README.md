# Test: WinningMoves-Test - Search Companies
API Used: Company House API

Time Taken: 5 hours

Problem: Lack of experience working with the Laravel API

Solution: Looked up official Laravel documentation and created a basic 'Test' Application where I created several different 'basic\' testing applications to help figure out the ins and outs of larval.

Problem: Connecting to Search Companies API

Solution: Looked up making a http request using authentication header to include the API Key provided by Search Companies house

Problem: Wanted CSS & JS Files to be included as default in the view

Solution: Researched the 'blade'9 templating engine. Allowed for a master template to be produced that includes the standard CSS & JS files on all views.

Problem: Getting HTTP requests to 'connect' to the appropriate controller

Solution: Read deep into standard 'route'94 procedures in Laravel, Set the pathnames to 'route' to the appropriate Controller AKA:

=> searchCompanitesController@index/
api/searchCompany => searchCompanyController
